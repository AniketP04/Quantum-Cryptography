# Quantum-Cryptography

The goal of quantum cryptography is to make it possible for two users to communicate in a way that is more secure than the guarantees provided by conventional encryption. In the past, cryptographic security was based on mathematics and took into consideration our current, limited capacity for calculation.The most recent innovation that appears to ensure privacy even when assuming eavesdroppers with infinite processing capacity is quantum cryptography, which employs photons and depends on the principles of quantum physics instead of "extremely large numbers."

Stephen Weisner initially put out the idea of quantum cryptography in his early 1970s paper "Conjugate Coding". Two scientists, Bennet and Brassard, who were familiar with Weisner's theories, were prepared to submit their own ideas by the time the proposal was published in Sigact News in 1983. They created the "BB84," the first quantum cryptography protocol, in 1984. Based on this, the first experimental prototype was created in 1991. It worked across a 32-centimeter range. The technology has improved through time, and the distance has grown to km.
